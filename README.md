```

## 🎯 Usage

### Face Recognition System

Run the advanced face recognition application:
```bash
python recognition_advanced.py
```

#### Main Menu Options:
1. **Register Person Face** - Register a new person with their name
2. **Recognize/Verify Face** - Start real-time face recognition
3. **View Registered People** - List all registered individuals
4. **View Memory Summary** - See recognition statistics
5. **View Recognition History** - Review recent recognition events
6. **Delete Registered Person** - Remove a person from the database
7. **Clear Memory** - Reset all memory/statistics
8. **Exit**

### Voice Interaction

#### Text-to-Speech Testing
```bash
python test_tts_direct.py
```

#### Full Voice Interaction
```bash
python live_voice_client.py
```

#### Start Voice Server
```bash
python server.py
```

## 🎨 Features in Detail

### Multi-Person Recognition

The system supports registering multiple people:
- Each person is identified by name
- 12 high-quality samples captured per person
- Strict multi-layer validation to prevent false positives
- Real-time display of person's name during recognition

### Face Quality Assessment

Automatic quality checking ensures reliable recognition:
- Size validation
- Aspect ratio checking
- Brightness assessment
- Blur detection
- Quality scoring: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor

### Recognition Memory System

Tracks and logs:
- Recognition sessions with unique IDs
- Success/failure statistics
- Detection timestamps
- Confidence scores
- Face quality metrics

### Performance Features

- **Frame Skipping**: Processes every 3rd frame for smooth 30 FPS display
- **Resolution Scaling**: Detection on 50% scaled frames, upscaled for display
- **Caching**: Recognition results cached between processing cycles
- **Buffer Optimization**: Minimal latency camera buffer
